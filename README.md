I was given two datasets and task for performing a data analysis on them. I used Jupyter Notebook along with various Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to complete this task. My first step was to import the datasets into my notebook and perform some initial data exploration. This included checking for data types and null values and making necessary changes such as converting the date datatype to datetime.

Next, I cleaned the data by removing null values in the Price column and filtering the data to only include sales information. I also dropped rows that were not required based on the "method" column which indicated whether the sales were successful or not.

I then concatenated the required columns from both datasets and removed unwanted values such as "Na". Using Matplotlib, I created several visualizations to help me analyze the data further. These included sales count by year, sales per month for all years, sales by distance from CBD, sales per month in 2018, top 10 suburbs with the most sales, suburbs according to average price, top expensive suburbs, expensive region names, and 2-bedroom properties to consider.

Finally, I identified the cheapest suburbs with 2-bedroom properties and the cheapest region name to buy a 2-bedroom property. I also determined the top sellers for 2-bedroom properties.

Overall, my task involved a comprehensive analysis of the provided datasets using a variety of techniques such as data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. My use of Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries allowed me to efficiently process and analyze the data, providing insights into the trends and patterns in the sales data.
